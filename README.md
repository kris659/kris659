# Shop management game
### [Codebase](https://github.com/kris659/ShopManagementGamePrototype-Codebase)
I'm currently working on a game in which you will manage your shop with the focus on managing the warehouse and transportation of goods.

I can't public the entire project, becouse it contains paid assets.
